# yudash
a UI utility library. Kinda of like lodash but for UI!

### Getting Started
https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation

### TODO
- Plugin faker.js and state management
--- Read about about global state management in react using useContext and useReducer Hooks
- Create Unit Test with jest
- Build out Theme generator that alters global theming. ex. DaisyUI
- ~~Add layout changer. its going to be a div wrapped around component and we can change col-span. to view how its displayed in different layout~~
- add system design page or section using mermaid.js
- Move Table features from vue to react
--- Build a way to interactively load data (user gets to choose the data amount, fields)
--- Build a way to interact with Features  (user gets to toggle features and see it happen in realtime)
- Apply Unit testing. Jest or check out what next,js has to offer.
